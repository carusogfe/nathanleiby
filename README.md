Ideas:

- Work for weight vs age, height vs age, height vs weight, etc etc
- Work against various standards (CDC, WHO, national goverments)

Todos:

- Clarify which chart is which. (and if dataset is for boys and/or girls)
- Smoothly change between charts ([How to dynamically add data to a chart](http://jsfiddle.net/mbeasley183/DbXhL/))
- Default is to select the last datum; highlight it and show tooltip
- Improved tickmarks
- Labels on the lines, or a legend (%tile, malnourished/severely/normal); color for different lines
- Improve tooltip style... [1](http://rveciana.github.com/geoexamples/d3js/d3js_electoral_map/tooltipCode.html#), [2](http://rveciana.github.com/geoexamples/?page=d3js/d3js_electoral_map/simpleTooltipCode.html), [3](http://bl.ocks.org/biovisualize/2973775)
